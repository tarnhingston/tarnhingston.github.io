<h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this class, along with updating this website, I have been doing some extension work for graphic design. I have been focussing mainly on Blender, as I'm already confident and competent in Photoshop, and enjoy 3D modelling.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">3D Logos (Semester 2)</h2>
<p>I have converted symbols/logos into 3D models by tracing their shape, extruding them, adding colour and texture, etc. then rendering (taking photos) of them. I have also been working on animating these, using various methods 
including bone animation, which I have been struggling with.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Floof (Semester 2)</h2>
<p>With Mr Hutchison's help, I made an object/creature I can only describe as a "Floof". I animated the camera to pan around it as it spins and turns, while its tentacles drift in the wind.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Sword (July - August)</h2>
<p>I decided I wanted to use Blender to make a 3D model, which I could print, and chose a sword because it was a simple shape that would both refresh my knowledge of Blender and be easy to print. I didn't have any major problems 
or struggles, however, this project was in no way too easy, and my time was definitely not wasted. Through this project, I learned many new skills, such as how use Blender's mirror modifier, which allows the user to only model 
half of an object, "mirroring" this half onto the other side, creating a perfectly symmetrical object. I also learnt the process of 3D printing an object, which, surprisingly, is something I've never actually known. 
On top of this, this project simply refreshed my memory on many aspects of Blender, especially my general understanding of the interface.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">Ram Skull (August - Current)</h2>
<p>After refreshing my knowledge of Blender and learning new skills, I decided to challenge myself. I found screenshots of a 3D modelled ram skull, from various angles, and decided to use these as a reference to make my own. 
This project is definitely proving to be challenging so far, however I've researched any problems I run into, and so far have not become stuck on anything. Because of this, I've already learnt many new skills, and vastly improved
my problem solving capabilities. </p>
