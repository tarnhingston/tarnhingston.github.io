<h2 class="subheading">7th March</h2>
<p>After a long wait, FarmBot finally arrived!</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">15th March</h2>
<p>Began unboxing FarmBot, checking everything was there and getting a feel for how everything would work.</p>

<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">19th March</h2>
<p>Looked at instructions and figured out exactly what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. We also measured the box and marked where we need to drill holes to attach the support plates.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">21st March</h2>
<p>With some anxiety, we made made our first irreversible move building FarmBot. We screwed in the support plates - luckily, nothing went wrong! - and attached the t-nuts to these.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">22nd March</h2>
<p>Attached the metal tracks to the support plates.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">26th March</h2>
<p>Attached the cable carriers to the tracks and began building the gantry - built and attached wheels to the support plates which will slide along the tracks, allowing the gantry to move.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">29th March</h2>
<p>Built the sides of the gantry, which was somewhat difficult and awkward because of the number and angles of the t-nuts, then attached them.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">5th April</h2>
<p>Built and attached the top bar of the gantry.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">6th April</h2>
<p>Added the belts and completed the gantry.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">9th April</h2>
<p>Realised how the eccentric spacers work, allowing us to fix the wheels so the gantry and top bar slide smoothly. This involved partially removing the belts so we could take the gantry off, then reattaching them.
Apart from a little struggle getting one of the belts back on, no problems were encountered.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">30th April</h2>
<p>Attached the most of the z-axis part and began sorting out the cables and cable carrier that go on it.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">2nd May</h2>
<p>Attached the cables and cable carrier on the z-axis part.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">3rd May</h2>
<p>Attached the cables and cable carrier to the top of the gantry and began sorting out the cables and cable carrier that go along the side of the garden bed.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">7th May</h2>
<p>Built the universal tool mount and cover.</p>
<img src="UTM.jpg" alt="Universal Tool Mount" class="blogimages">

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">8th May</h2>
<p>Began wiring up the universal tool mount cover.</p>
<img src="UTMWIRED.jpg" alt="Universal Tool Mount Cover Wired" class="blogimages">

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">7th - 17th May</h2>
<p>Finished wiring up the UTM. We struggled a lot attach the individual wires as it was so difficult and fiddly, so we only attached the mandatory four (out of twelve).</p>

<br/>
<br/>


<h2 class="subheading">21st - 28th May</h2>
<p>Built, attached and wired up the electronics box.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">21st - 30th May</h2>
<p>Built, attached and wired up the electronics box.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">1st - 6th June</h2>
<p>Downloaded software and sorted out the Raspberry Pi. Broke magnets on the 5th.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="subheading">15th June</h2>
<p>Discovered that we had been sent one wrong cable, which explained why we couldn't get one to reach the electronics box.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">6th August</h2>
<p>The new cable finally arrived, so we replaced the old, incorrect one. Because we had to avoid all the other cables coming out of place, we found the best way to do this was to remove most of the cable carrier tabs, then 
tape the new cable to the end of the old one and pull it through. This whole process took a lot of effort, and resulted in many hurt fingers.</p>
